# SLA Reporter

- Fun little project to generate some reports of an internal SLA board where clients can submit tickets
- Uses Monday.com's GraphQL API to get all the tickets which are then rendered on a webpage using vanilla JS + HTML/CSS
- Very fun/proof of concept, do not recommend looking at code quality for your own sanity
